# Hello-World
just trying to make something interesting.

I'm a beginner. A couple of years ago i understood, that i like programming. During these years i was learning html, css, sql and now i' m interesting in JavaScript and PHP. I've read that a lot of people advice a Python as a first language? but i' ve made decision to study after so as now i'm working as a delivery-driver and have not so much time to learn. My nearest goal is to become a web-developer and only after some experience in real projects i consider it is possible to be a programmer.
